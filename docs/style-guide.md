# OAF M&E — Newsletter Style Guide

This guide outlines the design and content standards for the OAF M&E Gazette newsletter to ensure consistency across all editions.

## Brand Identity

### Logo

- **Primary Logo:** The full-color `logo.svg` should be used on all digital and print materials where possible.
- **Usage:** Ensure there is clear space around the logo, and it is not stretched or altered. On colored backgrounds, the white text version should be used if the primary logo does not have enough contrast.

### Colors

- **Primary Green:** `#2b7f68` (RGB 45, 127, 103) — Used for mastheads, section headers, and primary links.
- **Secondary Gold:** `#e8b757` (RGB 232, 183, 87) — Used for accents, buttons (CTAs), and highlighting key information.
- **Text & Neutrals:**
    - `#111111` (Body Text): For all primary paragraph text.
    - `#333333` (Secondary Text): For less important text.
    - `#666666` (Captions/Footer): For image captions and footer text.
    - `#f7f7f7` (Background): For email and page backgrounds to provide a soft, off-white canvas.

## Typography

- **Headlines (H1, H2):** `Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif` — Should be in Primary Green (`#2b7f68`).
- **Body Text:** `Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif`, 16px — For all main content.
- **UI/Captions:** `Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif`, 12px — For metadata, captions, and footer content.

## Tone of Voice

- **Professional & Formal:** The newsletter should adopt a formal, authoritative tone similar to established financial publications.
- **Clarity & Brevity:** Headlines should be clear and informative. Body content should be concise and to the point.
- **Audience:** Assume the audience is internal stakeholders, partners, and donors who are familiar with M&E concepts.

## Content Structure

The newsletter should follow a consistent structure:

1.  **Masthead:** With logo, title, and issue date.
2.  **Hero Image:** A compelling, high-quality photograph related to the month's main theme.
3.  **Editor's Note:** A brief introduction from the M&E lead or editor.
4.  **Monthly Highlights:** 2-3 bullet points summarizing key achievements.
5.  **Deep-Dive Section:** A longer article (250-600 words) on a specific topic, project, or finding.
6.  **Priorities for Next Month:** A short, bulleted list of upcoming priorities.
7.  **Call to Action (CTA):** A button linking to a full report, dataset, or related document.
8.  **Footer:** With contact information and branding.

## Image Specifications

- **Format:** Use high-quality JPEGs for photos and PNGs or SVGs for graphics. Optimize all images for web to ensure fast loading times (aim for < 200KB per image).
- **Resolution:**
    - **Web/Email:** 72-96 DPI. Hero images should be at least 1200px wide.
    - **Print:** 300 DPI for any materials intended for print.
- **Alt Text:** All images must have descriptive alt text for accessibility (6-15 words).

## Deliverables

- **`templates/newsletter.html`:** The responsive HTML email template.
- **`assets/logo.svg`:** The primary logo.
- **`docs/style-guide.md`:** This style guide.
