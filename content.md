## Deep-Dive: Annual Farmer Survey Results

The 2025 planting survey was conducted provides critical insights into the livelihoods and challenges of the farmers we serve. This year's survey reached over 10,000 households and focused on the adoption of new seed varieties and the economic impact of our programs. Initial findings indicate a 25% increase in the adoption of drought-resistant maize, a significant milestone for food security in the region.

> "The data clearly shows that access to improved seeds is directly contributing to higher yields and increased household income. This is a testament to the hard work of our field teams and the resilience of the farmers."

Further analysis is underway to explore the relationship between training participation and farmer outcomes. A full report will be published by the end of January 2026.
